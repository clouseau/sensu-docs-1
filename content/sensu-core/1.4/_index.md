Sensu is the open-source monitoring event pipeline built to reduce operator burden and make developers and business owners happy.
Started in 2011, Sensu's pipeline approach solves the challenges of monitoring hybrid-cloud and container-based infrastructures with flexible, automated workflows and integrations with tools you already use.

**Automate Monitoring Workflows**: Take advantage of limitless pipelines to validate and correlate events, mutate data formats, send alerts, manage incidents, route metrics to time series databases, integrate with custom tooling, and more.

**Reduce Alert Fatigue**: Empower operators and developers with context-rich alerting, reporting, event handling, and auto-remediation.

**Replace Nagios**: Reuse Nagios plugins while consolidating monitoring tools with an architecture designed to sustain large scale deployments across multiple clouds.

### Monitoring for Your Infrastructure

> Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behaviors and outputs of a system and its components over time. - [Greg Poirier, Monitorama 2016](https://vimeo.com/173610062)

Sensu allows organizations to craft monitoring workflows that meet unique business requirements.
By providing flexible pipelines, Sensu enables you to focus on _what_ to monitor, rather than _how_.
Sensu is installed on your organizations infrastructure&mdash;not
a software-as-a-service solution&mdash;which means Sensu gives you full
control over the availability of your monitoring solution.

- **Monitor containers, microservices, and physical infrastructure using the same automated workflows.**

Sensu is a flexible, scalable monitoring event pipeline that works with
everything from the server closet to Kubernetes. Using custom-built tools?
Write your own [Sensu plugins][4] in the language of your choice (Ruby, Go, Python, you name it)
or integrate with the Sensu API.

- **Improve team signal by sending context-rich alerts and notifications.**

Get meaningful alerts when and where you need them.
Sensu integrates with the tools and services your organization already
uses like [PagerDuty][1], [Slack][2], and more. Check out the
[100+ plugins shared by the Sensu community][3].

- **Support cloud-based infrastructure with dynamic client registration and de-registration.**

When servers are provisioned, they automatically register themselves with
Sensu, so there's no need to manually add or configure new servers.

- **Use infrastructure-as-code best practices and industry-standard tools.**

Sensu exposes 100% of its configuration as JSON files, making it easy
to integrate with tools like [Chef][9], [Puppet][10], and [Ansible][11].

- **Open source software backed by Sensu Inc.**

Sensu Core is open-source software freely available under a
